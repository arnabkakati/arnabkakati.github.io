    <span style="color:#2B547E"> Project Scientist | Centre for Biomedical Engineering | Supervisor: Dr. Aarat P. Kalra </span> <br>

Here, I worked on a computational project to study triplet-state electronic energy migration in cytoskeletal protein polymers (microtubules, actin and intermediate filaments) via short-range Dexter Energy Transfer (DET).

    <span style="color:#2B547E"> Master's Student | Cancer Research Program | Supervisor: Dr. Ananda Mukherjee </span> <br>

For my master's dissertation thesis, I investigated the domain-specific role of PTEN tumor suppressor gene in modulating the UV-induced nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway.

    <span style="color:#2B547E"> Intern | Neurobiology Program | Supervisor: Dr. Moinak Banerjee </span> <br>

Throughout the course of this brief internsip, I learnt how to use definite computational tools and bioinformatics pipelines to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from next-generation sequencing (NGS) data that are involved in the onset of complex diseases like Autism Spectral Disorder (ASD).

    <span style="color:#2B547E"> Intern | Department of Microbiology | Supervisor: Dr. Rashmisnata Barman </span> <br>

As a laboratory intern, I conducted microbiological and biochemical assays to detect pathogenic microbes in patientâ€™s urine and blood samples. I have also processed tissue sections for histological and microscopic analysis using the principles of immunohistochemistry (IHC).
