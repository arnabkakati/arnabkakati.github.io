    <span style="color:#2B547E"> Project Scientist | Centre for Biomedical Engineering | Supervisor: Dr. Aarat P. Kalra </span> <br>

I worked on a computational project that aimed at investigating triplet-state electronic energy migration in cytoskeletal protein polymers (including microtubules and actin filaments) via the principles of Dexter Energy Transfer (DET).

    <span style="color:#2B547E"> Master's Research Scholar | Cancer Research Program | Supervisor: Dr. Ananda Mukherjee </span> <br>

My master's dissertation project focused on elucidating the domain-specific role of PTEN tumor suppressor gene in modulating the UV-induced nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway.

    <span style="color:#2B547E"> Research Associate | University of Maryland | Supervisor: Dr. Shiladitya DasSarma </span> <br>

I was selected for the Young Scientist Program of BMSIS to work on a bioinformatics project to validate the purple earth hypothesis thorugh phylogenetic analysis of the photopigment retinal, and check its emergence across other domains of life as well.

    <span style="color:#2B547E"> Intern | Neurobiology Program | Supervisor: Dr. Moinak Banerjee </span> <br>

Throughout the course of this brief internsip, I learnt how to use definite computational tools and bioinformatics pipelines to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from next-generation sequencing (NGS) data that are involved in the onset of complex diseases like Autism Spectral Disorder (ASD).

    <span style="color:#2B547E"> Intern | Department of Microbiology | Supervisor: Dr. Rashmisnata Barman </span> <br>

As a laboratory intern, I conducted microbiological and biochemical assays to detect pathogenic microbes in patientâ€™s urine and blood samples. I have also processed tissue sections for histological and microscopic analysis using the principles of immunohistochemistry (IHC).
