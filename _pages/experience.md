    <span style="color:#2B547E"> Project Scientist | Centre for Biomedical Engineering | Supervisor: Prof. Aarat Kalra </span> <br>

Here, I am assessing Dexter energy transfer (DET) in microtubules using qunatum-level Gaussian calculations and aim to further validate the computational findings with experimental approaches (using phosphorescence lifetime measurements).

    <span style="color:#2B547E"> MSc Dissertation | Cancer Research Program | Supervisor: Dr. Ananda Mukherjee </span> <br>

My master's dissertation project focused on elucidating the domain-specific role of PTEN tumor suppressor gene in modulating the UV-induced nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway.

    <span style="color:#2B547E"> Research Associate | University of Maryland | Supervisor: Dr. Shiladitya DasSarma </span> <br>

I was selected for the Young Scientist Program of BMSIS to work on a bioinformatics project to validate the purple earth hypothesis via phylogenetic analysis of the photopigment retinal, and check its emergence across other domains of life as well.

    <span style="color:#2B547E"> Intern | Neurobiology Program | Supervisor: Dr. Moinak Banerjee </span> <br>

I identified the SNPs that are involved in the onset of complex diseases like Autism Spectral Disorders (ASD) after meticulous analysis of Next Generation Sequencing data.

    <span style="color:#2B547E"> Intern | Department of Microbiology | Supervisor: Dr. Rashmisnata Barman </span> <br>

I conducted microbiological and biochemical assays to detect pathogenic microbes in patient’s urine and blood samples. I have also processed tissue sections for histological and microscopic analysis using the principles of immunohistochemistry (IHC).
