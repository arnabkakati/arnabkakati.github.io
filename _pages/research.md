Cells, during the entirety of its lifetime, is subjected to a multitude of alterations, brought on by variable factors. These alterations, however, also fuels the ultimate propaganda of life – survival against death. Given 3.8 billion years of evolution (ref - Cooper GM. The Cell: A Molecular Approach), cells have eventually developed definite “modus operandi” to counteract the remorse of the changes that could endanger their own integrity. Nevertheless, sometimes the best-laid methods fall apart and cells are left with an oblivion that begs the question, do I survive or is this the end instead? <br>
From a less-philosophical perspective, science has progressed far too ahead to put this oblivion into medical application. I, intend to do the same! <br>
Should the introduction sound interesting to you, consider perusing the scientific sub-disciplines that pique my interest.

An ailment, that stems out from within us, has been the reason behind one among six deaths across the globe (ref: World Health Organization). Despite numerous attempts the field of medicine has made to tackle cancer, the fundamental question stands still – why would we kill ourselves? What is that one definite cause behind a disease such as cancer? As presented in a series of publications titled ‘Hallmarks of Cancer’ by Hanahan and Weinberg, the molecular and physiological factors behind cancer has played a significant role in this catastrophe. However, do these explanations suffice to explain why a cosmic organism would attempt to demolish itself? At the same time, from a less hateful perspective, is cancer just a normal occurrence that everyone is ought to encounter sometime in their lives – some meant to be diagnosed and treated, and rest to go unnoticed? <br><br>

Owing to inevitable destiny or by unavoidable fate, DNA (the ‘multi-core’ information system of a cell) is often subjected to biochemical damages. Throughout time and evolution, different cell types have developed unique strategies for repairing this damage. For example, bacterial cells resolve UV-induced damage using an enzyme called photolyase, whereas mammalian cells employ a rather advanced NER pathway comprising of a cascade of DNA repair proteins. Nonetheless, the procedure is rather straightforward (for each and every cell): DNA damage, screening of the damage, and final repair/elimination choice. For a normal cell facing genomic instability, the intrinsic ‘repair’ matters; in the contrary, for a tumor cell with similar damage, an ‘elimination’ singal of the tumor itself can be induced from outside. This sets a perfect stage for integrating both fundamental and applied research. Consequently, a personal interest! <br><br>

Electromagnetic radiation (or light) has been a crucial part of life on the planet earth. Ranging from energy production process in plants to radiation therapy for cancer treatment, atomic-level photochemical effects are an ideal asset for sustaining life. Building on the fact that atoms and sub-atomic particles are the structural basis of molecules that ultimately gives shape and integrity to a cell, may photochemical studies of different cellular components like proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids answer some of the unanswered questions in biological sciences? A bigger science awaits behind the intrinsic ability of proteins (aromatic amino acids in specific) and nucleic acids to absorb EM radiation than merely utilizing this property for spectroscopic-level protein and DNA detection. <br><br>
